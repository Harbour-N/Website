# Workshop

Our team (<span style="color:magenta;">pink</span>) were runners up at the IMO workshop and recived $50,000 pilot fiundig for our project: "AR-agonist pre-treatment enables evolutionary steering in metastatic ER+ breast cancer". For more information on our teams specific aims visit the [IMO webpage](https://imoworkshop.org/IMO11/index.html). 

As Part of the workshop I also present my work in the Poster below.
